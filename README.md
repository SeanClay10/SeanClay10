## Featured Projects  

### 🐺 FracFeedExtractor
- **Description**: A system written in Python that leverages XGBoost and LLMs to extract predator-prey interaction data from a global database of diet surveys, enabling the validation of predator feeding fractions.
- **Key Features**:  
  - Preprocesses ecological text data and applies TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
  - Uses XGBoost to classify relevant publications with key predator diet metrics.
  - Utilizes local LLMs for deeper extraction and analysis of complex unstructured text.
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - Python
  - XGBoost
  - sk-learn
- **Impact**: This project accelerating ecological research by providing a scalable, reproducible method for data extraction and analysis. It turned the manual process into an automated pipeline, reducing data extraction from 10 minutes per PDF to just 30 seconds
